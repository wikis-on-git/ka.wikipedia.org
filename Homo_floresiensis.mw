'''''Homo floresiensis''''' ("ფლორესის ადამიანი") არის ''[[Homo|Homo-ს]]'' [[გვარი|გვარის]] ახალაღმოჩენილი [[სახეობა]], რომლის მახასიათებლებია პატარა ტანი და მცირე ზომის ტვინი. როგორც ჩანს, ეს სახეობა ჯერ კიდევ არსებობდა არცთუ ისე დიდი ხნის წინ, თანამედროვე [[ადამიანი|ადამიანის]] ''(Homo sapiens)'' პარალელურად, [[ინდონეზია|ინდონეზიის]] შორეულ კუნძულ [[ფლორესი|ფლორესზე]]. ამ კუნძულზე [[2003]] წელს აღმოჩენილ იქნა შვიდი [[ჩონჩხი|ჩონჩხის]] ფრაგმენტები და მათთან ასოცირებული [[ქვის ინსტრუმენტი|ქვის ინსტრუმენტები]].

Flores has been described (in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'') as "a kind of [[The Lost World (Arthur Conan Doyle)|Lost World]]", where archaic animals, elsewhere long extinct, had evolved into giant and dwarf forms through [[allopatric speciation]]. The island had dwarf [[elephant]]s (a species of ''[[Stegodon]]'', the recent ancestor of the [[Indian Elephant]]) and giant [[lizard]]s akin to the [[Komodo dragon]], as well as ''H. floresiensis'', which can be considered a species of dwarf human. The discoverers have nicknamed the diminutive species ''[[hobbit]]s'', after [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s fictional race of roughly the same height.

== Discovery ==
The first (and so far only) specimens were discovered by a joint [[Australia]]n-[[Indonesia]]n team of [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]] and [[archaeology|archaeologists]] looking on [[Flores]] for evidence of the original [[human migration]] of ''H. sapiens'' from [[Asia]] into [[Australia]]. They were not expecting to find a new species, and were quite surprised at the recovery of the remains of at least seven individuals, from 95,000 to 12,000 years old, from the Liang Bua [[limestone]] [[cave]] on Flores.

The specimens are not [[fossil|fossilized]], but were described as being "the consistency of wet blotting paper" ([http://www.nature.com/news/2004/041025/full/4311029a.html ''Nature'' News article]). Researchers hope to find preserved [[mitochondrial DNA]] to compare with samples from similarly unfossilised specimens of ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'' and ''H. sapiens''. The likelihood of there being preserved DNA is, however, low, as it degrades more rapidly in warm tropical environments; in such conditions it is known to degrade in as little as a few dozen years. Contamination from the surrounding environment seems highly possible given the moist environment in which the specimens were found.

== Small bodies ==
''[[Homo erectus]]'', thought by the discoverers to be the immediate ancestor of ''H. floresiensis'', was approximately the same size as another descendant species, modern humans.  In the limited food environment on Flores, however, ''H. erectus'' is thought to have undergone strong [[island dwarfing]], a form of [[allopatric speciation]] also seen on Flores in a dwarf species of ''[[Stegodon]]'' (a recent ancestor of the [[Indian Elephant]]) and other species as well as on other small [[island]]s.

Despite the size difference, the specimens seem otherwise to resemble in their features ''H. erectus'', known to be living in [[Southeast Asia]] at times coinciding with earlier finds of ''H. floresiensis''.  These [[homology (biology)|observed similarities]] form the basis for the establishment of the suggested [[cladistics|phylogenetic relationship]]. Despite a controversial reported finding by the same team of alleged material evidence of a ''H. erectus'' occupation 840,000 years ago, actual remains of ''H. erectus'' itself have not been found on Flores, much less [[Transitional fossil|transitional forms]].

The [[holotype|type specimen]] for the species is a fairly complete [[human skeleton|skeleton]] and near-complete [[skull]] of a 30-year-old female about 1 [[metre]] (3 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]] 3 [[inch]]es) in height. Not only is this a drastic reduction compared to ''H. erectus'', it is even somewhat smaller than the three million years more ancient ancestor [[Australopithecine]]s, not previously thought to have expanded beyond [[Africa]].  This tends to qualify ''H. floresiensis'' as the most "extreme" member of the extended human family. They are certainly the shortest and smallest. 

''Homo floresiensis'' is also rather tiny compared to the [[human height|modern human height]] and size of all peoples today. The estimated height of adult ''H. floresiensis'' is considerably shorter than the average adult height of even the physically smallest populations of modern humans, such as the African [[pygmy|Pygmies]] (< 1.5 m, or 4 ft. 11 in.), [[Twa]], [[Semang]] (1.37 m, or 4 ft. 6 in. for adult women), or [[Andaman Islands|Andamanese]] (1.37 m, or 4 ft. 6 in. for adult women). Mass is generally considered more [[biophysics|biophysically]] significant than a one-dimensional measure of length, and by that measure, due to effects of scaling, differences are even greater.  The type specimen of ''H. floresiensis'' has been estimated as perhaps about 25 [[kilogram|kg]] (55 [[pound|lb]]).  

''Homo floresiensis'' had relatively long [[arm]]s, perhaps allowing this small creature to [[climbing|climb]] to safety in the [[tree]]s when needed. 

Inevitable comparisons with modern human [[Achondroplasia|achondroplasiacs]] (about 1.2 m, or 3 ft. 11 in.) or other [[dwarfism|dwarf]]s, are flawed, as these people are not generally proportionally smaller than other humans, only short-limbed.

== Small brains ==
[[Image:Floresiensis.jpg|thumb|The skull of H. floresiensis.]]
In addition to a small body size, ''H. floresiensis'' had a remarkably small [[human brain|brain]].  The type specimen, at 380 [[millilitre|cm&sup3;]](23 [[inch|in&sup3;]]), is at the lower range of [[chimpanzee]]s or the ancient [[Australopithecine]]s.  The brain is reduced considerably relative to this species' presumed immediate ancestor ''H. erectus'', which at 980 cm&sup3; (60 in&sup3;) had more than double the brain volume of its descendant species.  Nonetheless, the [[brain to body mass ratio]] of ''H. floresiensis'' is comparable to that of ''H. erectus'', indicating the species were unlikely to differ in intelligence.  Indeed, the discoverers have associated ''H. floresiensis'' with [[human behavior|advanced behavior]]s.

There is evidence of the use of [[fire]] for [[cooking]].  The species has also been associated with [[stone tool]]s of the sophisticated [[Upper Paleolithic]] tradition typically associated with modern humans, who at 1310-1475 cm&sup3; (80-90 in&sup3;) nearly quadruple the brain volume of ''H. floresiensis'' (with body mass increased by a factor of 2.6).  Some of these tools were apparently used in the necessarily [[co-operation|cooperative]] [[hunting]] of local dwarf ''Stegodon'' by this small human species.

Flores, because of a deep neighboring [[strait]], remained isolated during [[Wisconsin glaciation|the most recent]] [[ice age]] despite the low [[sea level rise|sea level]]s that united much of the rest of [[Sundaland]].  This has led the discoverers of ''H. floresiensis'' to conclude that the species or its ancestors could only have reached the isolated island by [[ship transport|water transport]], perhaps arriving in [[bamboo]] [[raft]]s around 100,000 years ago.  This perceived evidence of advanced technology and cooperation on a modern human level has prompted the discoverers to [[hypothesis|hypothesize]] that ''H. floresiensis'' almost certainly had [[language]].  These suggestions have proved the most controversial of the discoverers' findings, despite the probable high intelligence of ''H. floresiensis''.

== Recent survival ==
The other remarkable aspect of the find is that this species is thought to have survived on Flores until at least as recently as 12,000 years ago. This makes it the longest-lasting non-modern human, long outsurviving the Neanderthals (''H. neanderthalensis'') who went extinct about 30,000 years ago. ''Homo floresiensis'' certainly coexisted with modern humans, who arrived in the region 35,000-55,000 years ago, for a long time, but it is unknown how they may have interacted.

Local [[geology]] suggests that a [[volcano|volcanic eruption]] on Flores was responsible for the demise of ''H. floresiensis'' in the part of the island under study at approximately 12,000 years ago, along with other local fauna, including the dwarf ''Stegodon''.

The discoverers suspect, however, that this species may have survived longer in other parts of Flores to become the source of the [[Ebu Gogo]] stories told among the local people. The Ebu Gogo are said to have been small, hairy, [[language]]-poor cave-dwellers on the scale of ''H. floresiensis''.  Widely believed to be present at the time of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] arrival five hundred years ago, these strange creatures are said to have last been spotted just a century ago.

Similarly, on the island of [[Sumatra]], there are reports of a one metre tall humanoid, the [[Orang Pendek]], which a number of professional scholars take seriously. Both foot prints and hairs have been recovered. Scholars working on the Flores man have noted that the Orang Pendek may also be surviving Flores men still living on Sumatra.

== Significance ==
The discovery is widely considered the most important of its kind in recent history, and came as a surprise to the [[anthropology|anthropological]] community. The new species challenges many of the ideas of the discipline. 

''Homo floresiensis'' is so different in form from other members of genus ''Homo'' that it forces the recognition of a new, undreamt-of variability in that group, and reaffirms an intellectual trend away from the idea of linear evolution.

No doubt this discovery provides more fuel for the fire of the perennial debate over the [[Single-origin hypothesis|Out-of-Africa]] or [[Multiregional hypothesis|Multiregional]] models of the [[speciation]] of modern humans, despite ''H. floresiensis'' not itself being an ancestor of modern humans.  Already, voices have been heard arguing it furthers either side.

The discovers of ''H. floresiensis'' fully expect to find the remains of other, equally divergent ''Homo'' species on other isolated islands of Southeast Asia, and do not think it impossible, if not quite "likely", that some lost ''Homo'' species could be found still living in some unexplored corner of jungle.

[[Henry Gee]], a senior editor of the journal ''Nature'', has agreed, saying, "Of course it could explain all kinds of legends of the little people.  They are almost certainly extinct, but it is possible that there are creatures like this around today. Large mammals are still being found. I don't think the likelihood of finding a new species of human alive is any less than finding a new species of [[antelope]], and that has happened."

== Reaction ==
Professor [[Teuku Jacob]], chief [[paleontologist]] of the Indonesian [[Gajah Mada University]], disagrees with the placement of the new finds into a new species of ''Homo''.  "It is a sub-species of ''Homo sapiens'' classified under the Austrolomelanesid race," he said.  He will attempt to prove that the find is from a 25-30 year-old [[omnivore|omnivorous]] subspecies of ''H. sapiens'', and not a 30-year-old female of a new species. He is convinced that the small skull is that of a mentally defective human.
