The reform program from 1989 included "people's enterprises" controlled
by the employees. However, only 7 "people's enterprises" were established.

Estonia has certainly chosen the most radical strategy of structural adjustment of all postsocialist
countries in Central/Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Between 1992
and early 1995, the country carried out a vast programme of liberalization and macrostabilization,
going way beyond the Polish or the Czech program of economic reform.

June 17, 1993 
Estonian Law on privatization was adopted by the Parliament (entered into force on July 24, 1993 
According to the law, three main types of privatization were set up: 
- sale of property in tender with preliminary negotiations 
- sale of property on a public or restricted sale 
- public sale of shares of commercial undertakings 

before 1991 leasing, coops,
employee-ownership
1992 no insider advantages
small privatization 1991-93
1993 large THA-privatization
=> much sold to foreigners
vouchers and reprivatization
of housing and land

Lithuania was the first country in Central and Eastern Europe to carry out a very ambitious
program of privatization. It foresaw mass privatization - distribution of vouchers to the
employees and the population as a whole - as an "efficient and fair" way to get rid of the
socialist system of ownership. As early as October 1990, Sajudis (political "movement for
restructuring") prepared a privatization program that became the December 1990 "Law on
the Accumulation of Private Capital of Employees in State Enterprises"; this law became
the basis of the July 1991 "Initial Privatization Program". While the Polish government
was failing to implement its Sectoral Privatization and Mass Privatization in 1990-92, and
while Czechoslovakia was still giving first thoughts to mass privatization, Lithuania went
ahead with a complete program as early as 1991

LAW ON PRIVATIZATION OF INSOLVENT STATE ENTERPRISES 23 July 1991
LAW On the Privatization of  Property of Agricultural Enterprises As amended by 7 April 1993)

The Latvian Privatisation Agency was founded on 22 April 1994 as a Non-Profit Organisation State Joint Stock Company. On 1 November 2004, the legal status of the Latvian Privatisation Agency was changed. Pursuant to the provisions of the Commercial Law, the Latvian Privatisation Agency was transformed into a State Joint Stock Company and entered into the Commercial Register.

This situation makes the Latvian case particularly relevant to other
post-socialist Republics of the former Soviet Union. It was only in 1994 that attempts to
streamline government control over restructuring led to a more promising approach.
Initially, the government envisaged an ambitious program of reform, expressed in the
Privatization law of June 1992; it foresaw the classical two steps for all the combinates:
corporatization, i.e. transformation into state-owned enterprises, then privatization.
But whereas macroeconomic reforms progressed systematically, structural reforms were
complicated by an increasingly complex institutional setting. Between 1992 and early 1995, only some 47 large enterprises were entirely privatized.
