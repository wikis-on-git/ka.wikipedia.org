== Formative years ==
J. S. Bach was born in [[Eisenach]], [[Germany]], in [[1685]] and died in 1750 at the age of 65. His father, [[Johann Ambrosius Bach]], was the town piper in [[Eisenach]], a post that entailed organizing all the secular music in town as well as participating in church music at the direction of the church organist, and his uncles were also all professional musicians ranging from church organists and court chamber musicians to composers, although Bach would later surpass them all in his art. In an era when sons were expected to assist in their fathers' work, we can assume J. S. Bach began copying music and playing various instruments at an early age. 

Bach's mother died when he was still a young boy and his father suddenly passed away when J. S. Bach was 9, at which time J. S. Bach moved in with his older brother [[Johann Christoph Bach]], who was the organist of [[Ohrdruf]] in Germany. While in his brother's house, J. S. Bach continued copying, studying, and playing music. According to one popular legend of the young composer's curiosity, late one night, when the house was asleep, he retrieved a manuscript (which may have been a collection of works by Johann Christoph's former mentor, [[Johann Pachelbel]]) from his brother's music cabinet and began to copy it by the moonlight. This went on nightly until Johann Christoph heard the young Sebastian playing some of the distinctive tunes from his private library, at which point the elder brother demanded to know how Sebastian had come to learn them.

[[Image:Young Bach2.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Bach as a young man]]

It was at Ohrdruf that Bach began to learn about [[organ (music)|organ]] building. The Ohrdruf church's instrument, it seems, was in constant need of minor repairs, and young J. S. Bach was often sent into the belly of the old organ to tighten, adjust, or replace various parts. Realizing that in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the church organ, with its moving bellows, manifold stops, and complicated mechanical linkages  from  the  keys and  pedals  to the many actual pipes, was the most complex machine in any European town, we can imagine that Sebastian may have been awed by it much as modern boys are fascinated by cars, trucks, and planes. This hands-on experience with the innards of the instrument would provide a unique [[counterpoint]] to his unequalled skill at playing the instrument; J. S. Bach was equally at home talking with organ builders and performers. 

While in school and as a young man, Bach's curiosity compelled him to seek out great organists of Germany such as [[Georg Böhm]], [[Dietrich Buxtehude]] and [[Johann Adam Reinken]], often taking journeys of considerable length to hear them play. He was also influenced by the work of [[Nicholas Bruhns]]. Shortly after graduation (Bach completed Latin school when he was 18, an impressive accomplishment in his day, especially considering that he was the first in his family to finish school), Bach took a post as organist at [[Arnstadt]] in Germany in [[1703]]. He apparently felt cramped in the small town and began to seek his fortune elsewhere. Owing to his virtuosity, he was soon offered a more lucrative organist post in [[Muhlhausen]]. Some of Bach's earliest extant compositions date to this period (including, according to some scholars, his famous [[Toccata and Fugue in D Minor]]), but owing to the general immaturity of this "early" Bach music, much of the music Bach wrote during this time has unfortunately been lost.

== Professional life ==
Still not content as organist of Muhlhausen, in [[1708]], Bach took a position as court organist and [[concert master]] at the ducal court in [[Weimar, Germany|Weimar]]. Here he had opportunity to not only play the organ but also compose for it and play a more varied repertoire of concert music with the dukes' ensemble. A devotee of [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, Bach's steady output of [[Fugue (music)|fugue]]s begins in Weimar. The best known example of his fugal writing is probably ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', which comprises 48 preludes and fugues, two for each major and minor key, a monumental work not only for its masterful use of counterpoint but also for exploring, for the first time, the full glory of keys--and the means of expression made possible by their slight differences from each other--available to keyboard musicians when their instruments are tuned according to [[Andreas Werckmeister]]'s system of [[well temperament]] or similar system.

Also during his tenure at Weimar, Bach began work on the Orgelbüchlein for Wilhelm Friedemann. This "little book" of organ music contains traditional [[Lutheran]] church hymns harmonized by Bach and compiled in a way to be instructive to organ students. This incomplete work introduces two major themes into Bach's corpus: Firstly, his dedication to teaching, and secondly, his love of the traditional [[chorale]] as a form and source of inspiration. Bach's dedication to teaching is especially remarkable. There was hardly any period in his life when he did not have a full-time apprentice studying with him, and there were always numerous private students studying in Bach's house, including such 18th century notables as [[Johann Friedrich Agricola]]. Still today, students of nearly every instrument encounter Bach's works early and revisit him throughout their careers.

Sensing increasing political tensions in the ducal court of Weimar, Bach began once again to search out a more stable job conducive to his musical interests. Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cöthen hired Bach to serve as his [[Kapellmeister]], that is, director of music.  Prince Leopold, himself a musician, appreciated Bach's talents, compensated him well, and gave him considerable latitude in composing and performing. However, the prince was [[Calvinist]] and did not use elaborate music in his worship, so that most of Bach's work from this period is secular in nature. The [[Brandenburg concerti]], as well as many other instrumental works, including the [[suite]]s for solo cello, the sonatas and [[partita]]s for solo [[violin]], and the orchestral suites, date to this period. 

In [[1723]], J. S. Bach was appointed [[Cantor]] and Musical Director of [[St. Thomas church]] in [[Leipzig]] in Germany. This post required him to not only instruct the students of the St. Thomas school in singing but also to provide weekly music at the two main churches in Leipzig. Rising above and beyond the call of duty, Bach endeavored to compose a new church piece, or [[cantata]], every week. This challenging schedule, which basically amounted to writing an hour's worth of music every week, in addition to his more menial duties at the school, produced some genuinely sublime music, most of which has been preserved. Most of the cantatas from this period expound upon the Sunday readings from the Bible for the week in which they were originally performed; some were written using traditional church hymns, such as ''Wachet auf! Ruft uns die Stimme'' and ''Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland'', as inspiration for the music. 

On holy days such as [[Christmas]], [[Good Friday]], and [[Easter]], Bach produced cantatas of particular brilliance, most notably the [[Magnificat]] for Christmas and [[St. Matthew Passion (Bach)|St. Matthew Passion]] for Good Friday. The composer himself considered the monumental St. Matthew Passion among his greatest masterpieces; in his correspondence, he referred to it as his "great Passion" and carefully prepared a calligraphic manuscript of the work, which required every available musician in town for its performance.  Bach's representation of the essence and message of Christianity in his religious music is considered by many to be so powerful and beautiful that in Germany he is sometimes referred to as the Fifth Evangelist.

== Family life ==
Bach married his second cousin, Maria Barbara Bach, on [[October 17]], [[1707]] after receiving a small inheritance. They had 7 children, 4 of whom survived to adulthood. Little is known of Maria Barbara. She died suddenly on [[July 7]], [[1720]] while Bach was travelling with Prince Leopold.

While at [[Cöthen]], Bach met Anna Magdalena Wilcke, a young [[soprano]]. They married on [[December 11]], [[1721]]. Despite the age difference (she was 17 years his junior), the couple seem to have had a very happy marriage. Anna supported Johann's composing (many final scores are in her hand) while he encouraged her singing. Together they had 13 children.

All the Bach children were musically inclined, which must have given the aging composer much pride. His sons [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach]], [[Johann Gottfried Bernhard Bach]], [[Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], and [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]] all became accomplished musicians, with C. P. E. Bach winning the respect of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]. Although the barriers to women having professional careers were great, all of Bach's daughters most likely sang and possibly played in their father's ensembles. The only one of the Bach daughters to marry, Elisabeth Juliana Friederica, choose as husband Bach's student Johann Christoph Altnickol. Most of the music we have from Bach was passed on through his children, who preserved much of what C. P. E. Bach called the "Old Bach Archive" after his father's death. 

At Leipzig, Bach seems to have fit in amongst the professoriate of the university, with many professors standing as god-parents for his children, and some of the university's men of letters and theology providing many of the [[libretto]]s for his cantatas. In this last capacity Bach enjoyed a particularly fruitful relationship with the poet [[Picander]]. Sebastian and Anna Magdalena also welcomed friends, family, and fellow musicians from all over Germany into their home; court musicians at Dresden and Berlin as well as musicians including [[George Philipp Telemann]] (one of Carl Philipp Emanuel's godfathers) made frequent visits to Bach's house and may have kept up frequent correspondence with him. Interestingly, [[George Friedrich Handel]], who was born in the same year as Bach, made several trips to Germany, but Bach was unable to meet him, a fact he regretted.

== Later life and legacy ==
Having spent much of the [[1720]]s composing weekly cantatas, Bach assembled a sizable repertoire of church music that, with minor revisions and a few additions, allowed him to continue performing impressive Sunday music programs while pursuing other interests in secular music, both vocal and instrumental. Many of these later works were collaborations with Leipzig's [[Collegium Musicum]], but some were increasingly introspective and abstract compositional masterpieces that represent the pinnacle of Bach's art. These erudite works start with the four volumes of his Clavier-Übung ("Keyboard Practice") a set of keyboard works to inspire and challenge organists and lovers of music that includes the 6 Partitas for keyboard (Vol. I), the Italian Concerto, the French Overture (Vol. II), and the [[Goldberg variations]] (Vol. IV). 

At the same time, Bach wrote a complete [[Mass in B Minor (Bach)|Mass in B Minor]], which incorporated newly composed movements with portions from earlier works.  Although the mass was never performed during the composer's lifetime, it is considered to be among the greatest of his choral works.

After meeting King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] in [[Potsdam]] in [[1747]], who played a [[theme (music)|theme]] for Bach and challenged the famous musician to improvise a six-part [[fugue]] based on his theme, Bach presented the king with a [[Musical Offering]] including several fugues and canons based on the "royal theme." Later, using a theme of his own design, Bach produced ''[[The Art of Fugue]]''. These 14 fugues (called Contrapuncti by Bach), are all based on the same theme, demonstrating the versatility of a simple melody. During his life time he composed over 1,000 pieces. 

Johann Sebastian Bach's contributions to music, or to borrow a term popularized by his student Lorenz Christoph Mizler, "musical science" are frequently compared to the "original geniuses" of [[William Shakespeare]] in English literature and [[Isaac Newton]] in physics.

Johann Sebastian Bach died in 1750.

== The BWV numbering system==
[[Image:BWV1001-cropped.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Violin Sonata #1 in G minor (BWV 1001) in Bach's handwriting]]
Johann Sebastian Bach pieces are indexed with BWV numbers, where BWV is ''Bach Werke Verzeichnis'' . The catalog, published in [[1950]], was compiled by [[Wolfgang Schmieder]] and the BWV numbers are sometimes referred to as Schmieder Numbers.  An obsolete system uses S, instead of BWV, for  Schmieder.

The catalog is organised thematically rather than chronologically: BWV 1-222 are [[cantata]]s, BWV 225-248 the large-scale choral works, BWV 250-524 [[chorale]]s and sacred songs, BWV 525-748 [[Organ (music)|organ]] works, BWV 772-994 other keyboard works, BWV 995-1000 [[lute]] music, BWV 1001-1040 [[chamber music]], BWV 1040-1071 orchestral music and BWV 1072-1126 [[canon]]s and [[fugue]]s.   In compiling the catalog Schmieder largely followed the Bach Gesellschaft Ausgabe, a comprehensive edition of the composer's works produced between [[1850]] and [[1905]].
