The True Jesus Church (真耶穌教會, ჩინური: Zhen Yesu Jiao hui) is an independent Chinese church that was established in [[პეკინი]], [[ჩინეთი]] in 1917. It belongs to the Pentecostal branch of [[ქრისტიანობა]] that emerged in the 1900s. Today there are approximately 1.5 million members in five continents. 

==The five doctrines of the church==
===Holy Spirit===
"Receiving the Holy Spirit, evidenced by speaking in tongues, is the guarantee of our inheritance of the Kingdom of Heaven". 

===Baptism=== 
"Water baptism is the sacrament for the remission of sins for regeneration. The baptism must take place in natural living water, such as the river, sea, or spring.

The Baptist, who already has had received baptism of water and the Holy Spirit, conducts the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And the person receiving the baptism must be completely immersed in water with head bowed and face downward". 

===Foot washing=== 
"The sacrament of feet washing enables one to have a part with the Lord Jesus. It also serves as a constant reminder that one should have love, holiness, humility, forgiveness and service.

Every person who has received water baptism must have his/her feet washed in the name of Jesus Christ. Mutual foot washing may be practiced whenever is appropriate". 

===Holy Communion=== 
"The Holy Communion is the sacrament to commemorate the death of the Lord Jesus Christ.

It enables us to partake of the flesh and blood of our Lord and to be in communion with Him so that we can have eternal life and be raised on the Last Day. This sacrament shall be held as often as possible. Only one unleavened bread and grape juice shall be used".

===Sabbath Day=== 
"The Sabbath day, the seventh day of the week (Saturday), is a Holy Day, blessed and sanctified by God. It is to be observed under the Lord's grace for the commemoration of God's creation and salvation and with the hope of eternal rest in the life to come".
